# Basic Video Prediction Configuration
# Usage: python predict.py --config predict.yaml

# Inference Settings
inference:
  checkpoint: "./runs/experiment1/best_model.pth"
  input_video: "./data/test_videos/drive_0003" # Can be a video file OR a directory of images
  output_dir: "./outputs/predictions"
  output_name: "prediction_result"
  device: "cuda"  # or "cpu"
  mode: "predict" # "predict" or "generate"

# Video Settings (Must match training)
video:
  frame_size: [256, 171]      # Height Width - MUST match training data!
  frame_interval: 1           # Sample every Nth frame

# Prediction Settings
prediction:
  num_context_frames: 8       # Number of frames to condition on
  num_future_frames: 1        # Number of future frames to predict (1 = save as image)

# NOTE: DO NOT override model and diffusion settings here!
# They are automatically loaded from the checkpoint's config.json
# to ensure perfect alignment with what was trained
